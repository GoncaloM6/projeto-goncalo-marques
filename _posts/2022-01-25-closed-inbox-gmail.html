    <p>Digital communication makes for a big part of our daily lives, allowing us to be reachable wherever and whenever. In the work context, this can bring more cons than pros. Out-of-hours emails are not a recent problem, but with more people working from home due to the pandemic and the line between personal and professional life becoming even more blurred, the issue has gained more relevance as studies show the harmful impact it has on our physical and emotional health.</p>

    <h3>Why Gmail?</h3>
    <p>Gmail is an international, massively popular platform used mainly for professional, work-related communications. It is the most popular email domain, easy to use and can accommodate accounts even from non-Google emails. But…it hasn’t innovated much in recent years. What features can we bring to Gmail that answer users’ current necessities?</p>

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>With Closed Inbox, you can choose what enters your inbox and when. Silence emails for a set period of time based on criteria such as labels or senders. Simply create a mode, choose what is blocked and for how long and work in peace.</p>
