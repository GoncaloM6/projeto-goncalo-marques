<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I’m a Product Designer born and raised in Cascais, Lisbon. I judge myself as someone with a great sense of empathy, good communication skills and an easy-going personality. I’m focused on problem-solving through research-based and user-centered design products developed in a creative approach to bring simple, meaningful and pragmatic solutions to the users.</p>
<p>Currently finishing a postgraduate course in Digital Experience Design at FBAUL and looking for a first job / internship where I can put to use my learned knowledge and be able to improve on a personal and professional level.</p>
<p>Outside of work I spend my times practicing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>mountain biking;</li>
    <li>rock climbing;</li>
    <li>trekking;</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m always looking to learn, improve and develop my skills and capabilities in inspiring team work environments.</p>
<p><a>Let’s talk!</a></p>
